# Basic Backend for Social Network

## Setup

- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the BE server

## Note

- For this to work, you'll need to have a local instance of mysql running. Be sure to run the SQL schema file in your MySQL tool to ensure a db has been created
- you'll need to head to `src/models/base.js` to change the values of your database credentials

Without the above, this service will not work.
